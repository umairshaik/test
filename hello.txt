create a repository and follow below
Commands As follow:

(Initial Commits)
git init
git add .   (# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.)
git commit -m "First commit"   (# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.)
git remote add origin remote repository URL  (# Sets the new remote)
git remote -v (Verifies the new remote URL)
git push origin master (# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin)


(create a branch)
git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch](push files in to the branch)


(Add a new remote for your branch :)
git remote add [name_of_your_remote] 
git push origin [name_of_your_remote]


(Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :)
git fetch [name_of_your_remote]

(Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :)
git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop

(Delete a branch on your local filesystem :)
git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]

(To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :)
git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]

(Delete the branch on github :)
git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]
